# NightShadow
NIghtShadow is a network and port scanner to idenitfy any issue with the ports.
The code also uses the socket library to sniff network traffic. It creates a raw socket and sets it to promiscuous mode to read all network traffic. It then reads and prints each packet it receives.

Note that this is just an example code snippet and it will need to be modified to fit your specific use case. Additionally, network scanning and packet sniffing can be highly regulated and you may need to obtain legal permission before performing these actions.
